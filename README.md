Answers to questions 3 and 5

**Question 5**

Mesh Renderer: used to render 3D objects in game in 2D representation. Uses geometric attributes of the object or environment to do so.
Box Collider: defines box shaped collision area around object. Used to simulate physical interactions between components. Similar to a 'hitbox' in a shooting game. 
Input.GetAxis Method: used to detect input from joysticks, controllers, or even just the keyboard. Allows user to interact with an object to move it within the game.
Rigid Body: enables object to act under Unity's physics engine. The object is able to respond to collision, gravity, and other outside forces.
